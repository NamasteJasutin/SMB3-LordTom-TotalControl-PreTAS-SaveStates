# SMB3-LordTom-TotalControl-PreTAS-SaveStates
Ripped SaveStates of Lord Tom's Total Control TAS Exploit which showcase SMB3 Exploit to inject arbitrary code and create payloads using controller inputs (P1&amp;&amp;P2). For more info and copyright, see; http://tasvideos.org/4961S.html . This is not my work, I did nothing to accomplish these exploits and controls, nor did I have anything remotely to do with the project. I merely ripped the video, ended the TAS after the payload and before the showcase as seen in his video, save the state to a file to play around with and decided to share it on the internet.
